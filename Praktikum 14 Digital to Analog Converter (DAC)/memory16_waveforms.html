<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file memory16.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altsyncram megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design memory16.vhd. For the purpose of this simulation, the contents of the memory at the start of the sample waveforms is assumed to be ( FFF0, FFF1, FFF2, FFF3, ...). The design memory16.vhd has one read/write port. The read/write port has 2048 words of 16 bits each. The output of the read/write port is registered by clock. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design under normal read conditions. The read happens at the rising edge of the enabled clock cycle. The output from the RAM is undefined until after the first rising edge of the read clock. </P>

<P><CENTER><FONT size=2>Fig. 2 : Waveform showing write operation </CENTER></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design under normal write conditions. The write cycle is assumed to be from the rising edge of the enabled clock in which wren is high till the rising edge of the next clock cycle. During a write cycle, the new data flows through to the output. Actual write into the RAM happens at the rising edge or falling edge of the write clock, depending on whether the RAM blocks are assigned to M-RAM or not. In the sample waveforms, they are shown to be on the falling edge of the write clock. </P>
